Multi-Token Discord Scheduler

Multi-Token Discord Scheduler is a web-based tool that allows users to schedule messages to multiple Discord channels at specified intervals using different Discord tokens. The tool supports managing multiple tokens, scheduling messages for different channels with unique messages, and provides real-time status updates for each scheduled message.

Multi-Channel Messaging: Schedule messages to multiple channels, each with its own unique message.

Interval-Based Scheduling: Define how frequently messages should be sent (in seconds).

Real-Time Message Logs: Track the logs for each scheduled message, showing when it was sent, and whether it was successful or failed.

Stop/Restart Scheduling: Toggle between stopping and restarting a scheduled message for any channel.

Error Tracking: Real-time status updates for each scheduled message, showing success or failure.
